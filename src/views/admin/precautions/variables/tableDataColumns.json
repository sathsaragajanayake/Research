    "name":"Looking down at your phone",
    "des":"When you bend your neck forward to stare down at your smartphone (adopting a posture sometimes known as ‘text neck’), the effect on your spine is as though your head were significantly heavier than it actually is.Of course, we’re all glued to our smartphones these days, but we’re not saying that you have to put your device down for good – just be aware of your posture when you’re using your phone, and try to avoid bending your neck forward if possible."

    "name":"Lifting heavy objects",
    "des":"Lifting large weights puts pressure on your spine, and if it’s already curving to one side, the extra pressure can make that curvature even more pronounced. Scoliosis sufferers should endeavour to avoid lifting heavy objects alone. If you find yourself tasked with carrying a large weight, ask someone else to help you with it."

    "name":"Certain exercises",
    "des":"Exercise is an important ally in the fight against scoliosis – indeed, our own ScoliGold treatment method is primarily exercise-based. However, certain exercises and stretches can do more harm than good when you’re coping with a curved spine."

    "name":"High heels, flip-flops, and other shoes that don’t provide much support",
    "des":"When you’re purchasing footwear, it’s important to look for shoes that will give your body the support it needs. High-heeled shoes can put your spine under a lot of stress, but so can overly flat footwear such as flip-flops. Try to wear shoes with good arch support (orthotics/insoles can help with this). "
