Pairing the acupuncture with her naturopathic practice works beautifully as she has a expansive breadth of knowledge and skills to support her clients in health and healing. She is one of the most compassionate and kind healthcare practitioners I know!\\n'"

Once serious illnesses were ruled out the specialists lost interest in helping me--regardless of the disruption these issues were causing in my life. Dr. Hagel never lost interest in me as a patient, and her continued efforts helped me get my life back. She patiently listened to every detail and remembered everything I had said. I always felt heard, and I was never rushed in any of our appointments. She was always ready with additional recommendations if I found any treatments ineffective. She never left me feeling hopeless, as many of the doctors before her had. I am forever grateful for her help. '"
